It was she who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire.  It was she who cooked the meals. It was she who kept the fire going. The poor girl could not stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.\n",

        "One day, big news came to town.  The King and Queen were going to have a ball!  It was time for the Prince to find a bride. All of the young ladies in the land were invited to come.  They were wild with joy! They would wear their most beautiful gown and fix their hair extra nice. Maybe the prince would like them!\n",
        "\n",
        "At Cinderella’s house, she now had extra work to do.  She had to make two brand-new gowns for her step-sisters.  \n",

        "\n",
        "“You?” yelled the stepmother.  “Who said YOU were going to the ball?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“What a laugh!” said one step-sister.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Such a mess!” They pointed at Cinderella.  All of them laughed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cinderella said to herself, “When they look at me, maybe they see a mess.  But I am not that way.  And if I could, I WOULD go to the ball.”\n",

        "\n",
        "“Ah, me!” said Cinderella sadly.  The carriage rode down the street.  She said aloud, “I wish I could go to the ball, too!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Then – Poof!\n",
        "\n",
        "All of a sudden, in front of her was a fairy.\n",

        "“You called?” said the fairy.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Did I?” said Cinderella.  “Who are you?”\n",

        "\n",
        "“Yes, you did,” said Cinderella.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then let me be the one to say what is possible or not!”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, I think you know I want to go to the ball, too.” She looked down at her dirty clothes.\n",

        "At once, Cinderella was all clean.  She was dressed in a beautiful blue gown.  Her hair was set up high on her head inside a golden band.\n",
        "\n",
        "“This is wonderful!” said Cinderella.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Who said I was done?” said the Fairy Godmother.  She tapped her wand again. At once, a beautiful carriage came to be, with a driver and four white horses.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "“Am I dreaming?” said Cinderella, looking around her.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“What is that?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“All of this lasts only to midnight.  Tonight, at the stroke of midnight, it will all be over.  Everything will go back to how it was before.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then I must be sure to leave the ball before midnight!” said Cinderella.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Good idea,” said the Fairy Godmother.  She stepped back. “My work is done.” And with that, the Fairy Godmother was gone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cinderella looked around her.  “Did that even happen?”  But there she stood in a fine gown, and with a golden band in her hair.  And there were her driver and four horses before her, waiting.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Coming?” called the driver.\n",
        "\n",
        "She stepped into the carriage.  And they were off.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over at the ball, the Prince did not know what to think.  “Why do you have that sad look on your face?” the Queen said to her son.  “Look around you! You could not ask for finer maidens than these.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I know, Mother,” said the Prince.  Yet he knew something was wrong. He had met many of the young women.  Yet after he said “hello,” one by one, he could find nothing more to say.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Look!”  Someone pointed to the front door.  “Who is that?”\n",
        "\n",
        "All heads turned.  Who was that lovely maiden stepping down the stairs?  She held her head tall and looked as if she belonged. But no one knew her.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There is something about her,” said the Prince to himself.  “I will ask her to dance.” And he walked over to Cinderella.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Have we met?” said the Prince.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The Prince felt a leap in his heart.  He and Cinderella danced. When the song was over, they danced again.  And then they danced again, and yet again. Soon the other maidens at the ball grew jealous.  “Why is he dancing all the time with her?” they said. “How rude!”\n",
        "\n",
        "But all the Prince could see was Cinderella.  They laughed and talked, and they danced some more.  In fact, they danced for so long that Cinderella did not see the clock.\n",

        "“Dong!” rung the clock.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Goodbye!” said Cinderella. Up, up the stairs she ran.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Dong!” went the clock.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Please, stop for a moment!” said the Prince.\n",

        "“Oh, dear!” she said as one glass slipper fell off her foot on the stair.  But Cinderella kept running up.\n",

Tonight, at the stroke of midnight, it will all be over.  Everything will go back to how it was before.”\\n\\n“Then I must be sure to leave the ball before midnight!” said Cinderella.\\n\\n“Good idea,” said the Fairy Godmother in a huff.  the Fairy Godmother in a huff stepped back. “My work is done.” And with that, the Fairy Godmother in a huff was gone.\\n\\nCinderella looked around the Fairy Godmother in a huff.  “Did that even happen?”  But there the Fairy Godmother in a huff stood in a fine gown, and with a golden band in the Fairy Godmother in a huff hair.  And there were the Fairy Godmother in a huff driver and four horses before the Fairy Godmother in a huff, waiting.\\n\\n“Coming?” called the driver.\\n\\nthe Fairy Godmother in a huff stepped into a beautiful carriage.  And they were off.\\n\\nOver at the ball, the Prince did not know what to think.  “Why do you have that sad look on your face?” the Fairy Godmother in a huff said to the Fairy Godmother in a huff son.  “Look around her son! You could not ask for finer maidens than these.”\\n\\n“I know, the Fairy Godmother in a huff,” said the Prince.  Yet the Prince knew something was wrong. the Prince had met many of the young women.  Yet after the Prince said “hello,” one by one, the Prince could find nothing more to say.\\n\\n“Look!”  Someone pointed to the front door.  “Who is that?”\\n\\nAll heads turned.  Who was that lovely maiden stepping down the stairs?  the Fairy Godmother in a huff held the Fairy Godmother in a huff head tall and looked as if the Fairy Godmother in a huff belonged. But no one knew the Fairy Godmother in a huff.\\n\\n“There is something about the Fairy Godmother in a huff,” said the Prince to the Prince.  “I will ask the Fairy Godmother in a huff to dance.” And the Prince walked over to Cinderella.\\n\\n“Have we met?” said the Prince.\\n\\n“I am pleased to meet you now,” said Cinderella with a bow.\\n\\n“I feel as if I know you,” said the Prince.  “But of course, that is impossible.”\\n\\n“Many things are possible,” said Cinderella, “if you wish Many things to be true.”\\n\\nthe Prince felt a leap in the Prince heart.  the Prince and Cinderella danced. When the song was over, He and Cinderella danced again.  And then He and Cinderella danced again, and yet again. Soon the other maidens at the ball grew jealous.  “Why is the Prince dancing all the time with the Fairy Godmother in a huff?” He and Cinderella said. “How rude!”\\n\\nBut the Prince could see was Cinderella.  He and Cinderella laughed and talked, and He and Cinderella danced some more.  In fact, He and Cinderella danced for so long that Cinderella did not see the clock.\\n\\n“Dong!” said the clock.\\n\\nCinderella looked up.  \\n\\n“Dong!” went the clock again.  \\n\\nCinderella looked up again.  “Oh, my!” Cinderella cried out.  “It is almost midnight!”\\n\\n“Dong!” rung the clock.  \\n\\n“Why does that matter?” said the Prince.\\n\\n“Dong!” called the clock.\\n\\n“I must go!” said Cinderella.  \\n\\n“Dong!” went the clock.\\n\\n“But we just met!” said the Prince.  “Why leave now?”\\n\\n“Dong!” rung the clock.\\n\\n“I must GO!” said Cinderella.  Cinderella ran to the steps.\\n\\n“Dong!” said the clock.\\n\\n“I cannot hear you,” said the Prince.  “the clock is too loud!”\\n\\n“Dong!” rung the clock.\\n\\n“Goodbye!” said Cinderella. Up, up the stairs Cinderella ran.\\n\\n“Dong!” went the clock.\\n\\n“Please, stop for a moment!” said the Prince.\\n\\n“Oh, dear!” Cinderella said as one glass slipper fell off Cinderella foot on the stair.  But Cinderella kept running up.\\n\\n“Dong!” said the clock.\\n\\n“Please wait a moment!” said the Prince.  \\n\\n“Dong!” rung the clock.\\n\\n“Goodbye!” Cinderella turned one last time.  Then Cinderella rushed out the door.\\n\\n“Dong!”  the clock was quiet. the clock was midnight.  \\n\\n“Wait!” called the Prince.  the Prince picked up one glass slipper and rushed out the door.  the Prince looked around but could not see Cinderella blue dress anywhere.  “This is all I have left from Cinderella,” the Prince said, looking down at one glass slipper.  the Prince saw that it was made in a special way, to fit a foot like none other. “Somewhere there is one glass slipper,” the Prince said.  “And when I find it, I will find Cinderella, too.  Then I will ask Cinderella to be my bride!”\\n\\nFrom hut to hut, from house to house, went the Prince.  One young woman after another tried to fit One young woman after another foot inside one glass slipper.  But none could fit. And so the Prince moved on.\\n\\nAt last the Prince came to Cinderella’s house.  \\n\\n“the Prince is coming!” called one step-sister as one step-sister looked out the window.\\n\\n“At the door!” screamed one step-sister.  \\n\\n“Quick!” yelled the stepmother.  “Get ready! One of you must be the one to fit her foot in one glass slipper.  No matter what!”\\n\\nthe Prince knocked.  the stepmother flew open the door.  “Come in!” the stepmother said. “I have two lovely daughters for you to see.”\\n\\none step-sister tried to place one step-sister in one glass slipper.  one step-sister tried hard, but it just would not fit. Then one step-sister tried to fit one step-sister inside.  one step-sister tried and tried with all one step-sister might, too. But no dice.\\n\\n“Are there no other young women in Cinderella’s house?” said the Prince.\\n\\n“None,” said the stepmother.\\n\\n“Then I must go,” said the Prince.\\n\\n“Maybe there is one more,” said Cinderella, stepping into the room.\\n\\n“I thought you said there were no other young women here,” said the Prince.\\n\\n“None who matter!” said the stepmother.\\n\\n“Come here,” said Cinderella stepped up to Cinderella.  the Prince got down on one knee and tried one glass slipper on her foot.  It fit perfectly! Then, from one step-sister pocket Cinderella took out something. It was the other glass slipper!\\n\\n“I knew It!” the Prince cried.  “You are the one!”\\n\\n“WHAT?” shouted a step-sister.  \\n\\n“Not the Prince!” screamed one step-sister.\\n\\n“This cannot BE!” yelled the stepmother.  \\n\\nBut it was too late.  the Prince knew that Cinderella was the one.  the Prince looked into the Prince eyes. the Prince did not see the cinders in the Prince hair or the ashes on the Prince face.\\n\\n“I have found you!” the Prince said.\\n\\n“And I have found you,” said Cinderella.\\n\\nAnd so Cinderella and the Prince were married, and Cinderella and the Prince lived happily ever after.'"

Poor Cinderella could not stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.\\n\\n“What a mess!” Poor Cinderella two stepsisters laughed.

Maybe the Prince would like All of the young ladies in the land!\\n\\nAt Cinderella’s house, the Prince now had extra work to do.  the Prince had to make two brand-new gowns for the Prince step-sisters.  \\n\\n“Faster!” shouted one step-sister.\\n\\n“You call that a dress?” screamed the other.  \\n\\n“Oh, dear!” said Cinderella.  “When can I–“\\n\\nThe stepmother marched into the room.  “When can you WHAT?”\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said the Prince, “when will I have time to make my own dress for the ball?”\\n\\n“You?” yelled The stepmother.  “Who said YOU were going to the ball?”\\n\\n“What a laugh!” said one step-sister.\\n\\n“Such a mess!” They pointed at Cinderella.  All of They laughed.\\n\\nCinderella said to Cinderella, “When They look at Cinderella, maybe They see a mess.  But I am not that way.  And if I could, I WOULD go to the ball.”\\n\\nSoon the time came for the stepmother and step-sisters to leave for the big party.\\n\\n\\nthe stepmother and step-sisters to leave for the big party fine carriage came to the door. the stepmother and step-sisters hopped inside.

Their fine carriage rode down the street.  her said aloud, “I wish I could go to the ball, too!”\\n\\nThen – Poof!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, in front of her was a fairy.\\n\\n“You called?” said a fairy.\\n\\n“Did I?” said Cinderella.  “Who are you?”\\n\\n“Why, your Fairy Godmother, of course!  I know your wish.  And I have come to grant your wish.”\\n\\n“But…” said Cinderella, “your wish is impossible.”\\n\\n“Excuse me!” said the Fairy Godmother in a huff.  “Did I not just show up out of thin air?”\\n\\n“Yes, you did,” said Cinderella.\\n\\n“Then let me be the one to say what is possible or not!”\\n\\n“Well, I think you know I want to go to the ball, too.” her looked down at her dirty clothes.\\n\\n “But look at the Fairy Godmother in a huff.”\\n\\n“You do look a bit of a mess, child,” said the Fairy Godmother in a huff.\\n\\n“Even if I had something nice to wear,” said her, “I would have no way to get there.”\\n\\n“Dear me, all of that is possible,” said a fairy.
